Path to Emacs
==============

I've used Emacs a small bit back in college... however, I'm spending a lot of my
time these days moving between different code editors, and the differences in
each are really starting to get to me. Couple that, with IDEs getting slower and
slower while not providing me with a huge boon in productivity, it's time that I
make the switch over to something more tenable.

This is that solution. 

I'm an Emacs noob; you probably don't want to look at anything here unless you
are looking for things to poke fun at me with.
